# üåê Website Design Project ‚Äì "Paws & Claws Cafe"

Welcome to my website project created for one of my **school assignments**, where we were asked to conceptualize and design a complete website using Dreamweaver.

This project is called **Paws & Claws Cafe** ‚Äî a fictional dog & cat cafe featuring a custom-designed logo to strengthen brand identity.  
It was a fun blend of design creativity and technical layout planning!
