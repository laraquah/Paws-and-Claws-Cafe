# 🌐 Website Design Project – "Paws & Claws Cafe"

Welcome to my website project created for one of my **school assignments** where we were asked to conceptualize and design a complete website using Dreamweaver.

This project is called **Paws&Claws Cafe** — a fictional dog & cat cafe with its own logo to strengthen brand identity. It was a fun blend of design creativity and technical layout planning!
